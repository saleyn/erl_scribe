<h1> Erlang Scribe Logger </h1>

There seems to be a good deal scribe examples and code for php and python. 
However, I could not find much on erlang and scribe. This is an example on how to 
start logging to scribe with erlang. This example is a client thrift connection to a 
local scribe server.

This fork supports running Scribed on UNIX domain socket with:

1. Thrift:  https://github.com/saleyn/thrift/tree/uds
2. Scribed: https://github.com/saleyn/scribe/tree/ssl
3. Erlang UDS: https://github.com/saleyn/euds

<h2> Install Software needed. </h2>

You will need to install boost, thrift, and scribe.

Boost - http://www.boost.org/

Thrift - http://incubator.apache.org/thrift/

Scribe - http://github.com/facebook/scribe

<h1> Steps </h1>

NOTE: These steps are in the Makefile. You could also just type `make` and then install the
compiled beams wherever needed.

<h2> Generate code with thrift </h2>

You will then need to generate the facebook scribe code.

You have to grab facebook fb303.thrift file from the thrift/contrib/fb303/if/ directory.

Then add the scribe.thrift definitions. This is already done for you in this repo in the
file scribe.thrift.

Run `thrift --gen erl scribe.thrift` and that will generate the code in the 'gen-erl' directory.

Compile the code with `erlc -o ebin gen-erl/*.erl`

Then install the beams in an erlang path.

You will then be able to start logging! See example.erl for a logging example.
